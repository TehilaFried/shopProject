            <p>If you are not completely happy with any items from your order, you may return them to us within <strong>30 days</strong> from the date of delivery (subject to the conditions below) for a refund or store credit (you can choose on your returns form). Please note your returns must be delivered to us within this time frame.</p>
            <h2>Returns &amp; home pick-ups</h2>
            <p>We are pleased to offer a returns collection service to all customers for any purchases that meet our Returns Policy. Every package that we ship out includes a pre-paid returns label.</p>
            <h2>Exchange</h2>
            <p>To avoid disappointment we advise that you place a new order for any items you wish to exchange for and request a refund for your return, as the items you want may sell out in the time it takes for us to receive your return. We are not able to hold items and cannot guarantee their availability prior to receiving your return.</p>
            <h2>Conditions for return</h2>
            <p>Items must be in brand new condition and show no signs of wear with all original packaging, garment tags, and labels still attached. Original shoe boxes and other containers that products are sold in are considered part of the product and must also be returned in undamaged and unused condition. Items returned without their branded packaging will not be accepted.</p>
            <p>We do not accept items that have been damaged by wear and tear, altered, or washed incorrectly (please check washing instructions on all garments before handling). When trying items on, please be sure they do not come in contact with perfumes, sprays, creams, or other chemicals, and be sure to try shoes on a soft clean surface.</p>
            <h2>Fees</h2>
            <p>The delivery cost of the return package will be deducted from the refund amount. This price may vary depending on the weight, volume, and country of the returning package.</p>
            <p>For orders within the European Union, any shipping or gift wrapping fees are non-refundable. Kindly note that for international orders the costs of gift wrapping, shipping, as well as any import taxes and duties paid are non-refundable.</p>
            <p>Please note BAMBINIFASHION.COM monitors the number and condition of products returned and orders cancelled by customers. Violations of our returns policy, frequent returns or cancellations will be flagged and may, at our discretion, lead to the closure of your account or future orders being refused.</p>
            <h2>Exclusions</h2>
            <p>Kindly note that we do accept the return of swimwear, but only if the original hygienic sticker (if applicable) was not removed and itâ€™s still in its place.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the aforementioned policy, BAMBINIFASHION.COM reserves the right to make any final decision in case of refund requests based on unique and/or extraordinary circumstances that might arise from objective difficulties during the return process.
