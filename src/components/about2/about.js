           <p>BAMBINIFASHION looks to the future of children’s clothing to anticipate the needs of our clients by offering a mix of high-end European labels like Gucci, Fendi and Dolce &amp; Gabbana as well as artisanal up-and-coming labels. With over 100+ luxury brands to choose from it is the source of inspiration and fun for our global customer base.</p>

           <p>With more than 70 years of experience and two shops in Vienna, we are one of Europe’s largest brick and mortar luxury children’s fashion retailers with an ever-expanding online shop for kids aged 0-16. Featured in <em>Der Standard</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Vogue Bambini</em>, we continue to inspire and surprise the children’s fashion industry.</p>

           <h2>Our Vision</h2>
           <p>More and more, we are seeing a radical shift in the children's fashion industry, where kids can curate and share all their favourite looks using innovative platforms like Instagram. Our logo communicates this vision, a bird flying the coop.</p>

           <p>“The bird breaking free from the gilded cage is a powerful metaphor and a reminder of the importance of being yourself.”<br />

<p>Our focus isn’t wholly on the clothes, we also draw inspiration from the tiny people who wear our collections, anticipating the needs of the next generation of mini fashion lovers. We remind our customers there is something good to be found in fashion and space it gives us to communicate with others. In this sense, we are giving our audience a platform, a nice tool or gift to express themselves outside the box.</p>
<h2>Join The Revolution</h2>
<p>We work with a mix of top influencers to showcase the self-styled generation across the world. We represent all ages, nationalities and lifestyles.
