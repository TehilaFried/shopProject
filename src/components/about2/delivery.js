            <p>All orders received before 2 PM CEST will be dispatched on the same working day (excluding bank holidays and other public holidays). Orders received after 2 PM CEST will be dispatched the next working day. Please note all orders placed after 2 PM on Friday will be dispatched the following Monday.</p>
            <p>BAMBINIFASHION.COM will email customers tracking details once the order has been received and dispatched. Should you find your parcel is delayed, please double-check tracking details. In some cases, your shipment may be held or already delivered. If you cannot locate your parcel, please contact BAMBINIFASHION within 10 days of your shipment’s estimated delivery date.

            <h2>Paying Customs Duties &amp; Taxes</h2>
            <p>Depending on the country, we will cover any customs duties or taxes. This minimizes delays or additional charges. The total amount at checkout is the final amount for your shipment. Delivery Duty Paid also known as DDP services are displayed in the chart above and the options at checkout will read ‘IMPORT DUTY PAID’. We recommend customers choose this shipping option to optimize their delivery experience. However, it is important to check on the product page if your country and region qualify for DDP services.</p>
            <p>For any country NOT eligible for DDP services, the shipping process is different. When your shipment is received in your country, it may be liable for Customs Duty and Tax. Your local customs office will typically hold the parcel until all fees have been paid. If duties and taxes are not covered, your parcel may be destroyed or returned to us. Customs duties and taxes are determined independently of BAMBINIFASHION. We do not have control over the charges incurred. We reserve the right to deduct ANY loss in value of merchandise from the order value before refunds are processed. We recommend customers check with local postal services if they are not sure about custom charges in their country.</p>
